Given some items, each item consisting of a weight and value, we want to select the items so as to maximize the total value while staying under some weight limit. Inside simulated_annealing.py is the starter code comparing a greedy solution to your SA solution. The function simulated_annealing should return a list of values your algorithm has accepted (value meaning the total value of your chosen items). Running the file will generate a plot comparing your SA values to the greedy solution. Submit your code and in your written homework attach the plot as well as the total value, weight, and contents of the bag of your best solution (similar to what's printed in the starter code for the greedy solution).\n",

    "Annie is a 5-year old girl who *loves* eating candy and is ambivalent regarding vegetables. She can either choose to eat candy (Hershey's, Skittles, Peanut Butter Cups) or eat vegetables during every meal. Eating candy gives her +10 in happiness points, while eating vegetables only gives her +4 happiness points. But if she eats too much candy while sick, her teeth will all fall out (she won't be able to eat any more). Annie will be in one of three states: healthy, sick, and toothless. Eating candy tends to make Annie sick, while eating vegetables tends to keep Annie healthy. If she eats too much candy, she'll be toothless and won't eat anything else. The transitions are shown in the table below.\n",

    "Ant colony optimization is an optimization technique that was inspired by the foraging behavior of real ant colonies.  When searching for food, ants initially explore the area surrounding their nest in a random manner. Ants communicate indirectly by means of chemical pheromone trails, which help them find the shortest paths between their nest and the nearest food. While moving, they leave a trail of chemical pheromone behind them. Once an ant finds food, they vary the amount of pheromone they leave depending on the quality and quantity of food. This indirect communication between ants via pheromone trails enables them to find the shortest paths between their nest and the food sources.\n",
