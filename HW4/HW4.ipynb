The game finishes when the subsequence \"HTH\" appears, and whoever last flips the coin wins. Each player can flip the coin for multiple turns in a row, and the rules for stopping and switching to the other partner are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every time Aidi flips the coin, she also flips an extra unfair coin (P(H) = 0.3). She stops if the extra unfair coin lands heads. Otherwise, she keeps flipping the fair and extra biased coin (at the same time). The flips of the extra coin are not recorded.\n",
