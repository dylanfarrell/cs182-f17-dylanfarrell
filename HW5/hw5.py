        We will model each possible rating (one of the five numbers of stars)
        as a die, with each word in the dictionary as a face.

        This is a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, because the words are
        drawn from a per-rating multinomial distribution and we treat
        each word in a review as independent (conditioned on the rating). That is,
        once the rating has emitted one word to the review, the next word
        has the same distribution over possible values as the first.

        In this question, you will write a function that computes p(word|rating), the
        probability that the rating under question will produce
        each of the four words in our dictionary. We will run this function
        5 times, once for each rating. We pass in the number of times each

        You'll notice that actual words didn't appear in the last question.
        Array indices are nicer to work with than words, so we typically

        review strings into lists of integers. You will count the occurrences
        of each integer in reviews of each class.

        The infile has one review per line, starting with the rating and then a space.
        Note that the "words" include things like punctuation and numbers. Don't worry
        about this distinction for now; any string that occurs between spaces is a word.

        You must do three things in this question: build the dictionary,
        count the occurrences of each word in each rating and count the number
        of reviews with each rating.
