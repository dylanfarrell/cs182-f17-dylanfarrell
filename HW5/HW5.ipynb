    "You are an NFL referee scheduled for the upcoming Thanksgiving game with the Redskins playing the Cowboys. An NFL executive gives you a coin to use for the opening toss. Given the Cowboys' recent success and knowing how the league benefits from it, you're suspicious of the fairness of the coin. Suppose the coin has a constant, unknown probability $0 < p < 1$ of landing on heads. Come up with a flipping strategy that would simulate a fair coin, i.e. the event you label \"heads\" will occur an expected 50% of the time."
